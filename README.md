You can play the game [here](https://llms-first-projects.onrender.com/). Please note that the server may take a few minutes to start up on first access, as it automatically shuts down after 15 minutes of inactivity to conserve resources. If you enjoy the game and would like to help keep the servers running continuously, please consider supporting this project!
