Tech Stack Choice

To achieve "cool, fast, and simple," here's a recommended stack:

Frontend Framework: SvelteKit

Why? Compiles away the framework overhead, resulting in highly performant vanilla JavaScript. It's known for its simplicity, excellent developer experience, and built-in features like routing and server-side rendering (optional, but good for performance). It's modern and "cool."

Alternative: If you prefer Python end-to-end, HTMX with FastAPI/Flask serving HTML fragments is incredibly fast to develop and very performant. But SvelteKit offers a more typical SPA-like feel which might be considered more "cool" by some.

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Why? Utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of custom designs without writing much custom CSS. Excellent for responsiveness and keeps bundle sizes small. Very popular and gives a modern look.

Backend API Wrapper: FastAPI (Python)

Why? You need a way for the frontend (JavaScript in the browser) to talk to your Python backend logic. FastAPI is incredibly fast, easy to learn, provides automatic interactive documentation (Swagger UI), and integrates perfectly with your existing Python code. We'll wrap your FlightAnalysisSystem in API endpoints.

Icons: Heroicons (or similar SVG icon library)

Why? Simple, beautiful SVG icons that integrate well with Tailwind CSS.
