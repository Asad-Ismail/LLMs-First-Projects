Game Overview
"Tap Dash" is a one-touch runner where you control a colorful character that automatically moves forward. Tap anywhere on screen to jump over obstacles and collect glowing orbs. The unique twist: each tap creates a colorful trail that becomes part of the obstacle course for future runs!
Why This Works
* One-Tap Controls: Just tap anywhere to jump - that's it!
* Self-Explanatory: See character running toward obstacle = tap to jump
* Instant Understanding: No tutorial needed - human instinct knows to jump over obstacles
* Visual Feedback: Your colorful trails build up over time creating a unique level
Technical Implementation
* Engine: ThreeJS with minimal physics
* Size: Under 500KB total
* Controls: Single tap mechanic works identically on all devices
What Makes It Unique
The trails you leave behind with each jump become part of the course for your next run! This creates a constantly evolving, personalized level without any complex mechanics.
Visual Style
* Bright, bold colors with simple shapes
* Character is a glowing sphere that leaves trails when jumping
* Clean, minimal environment with high contrast
This game requires zero explanation - people will immediately understand "tap to jump over things" when they see the character and obstacles. The unique twist of your trails becoming obstacles adds depth without complexity.

1- Add fewer particles to the trail, reducing the particle count per trail from 25 to 2-4, adjusting size or opacity to compensate visually.
Impact: Fewer objects to render, easing GPU load with minimal visual compromise.

2- lets reduce number fo trails to 2 instead of 20 something like that 
3- is this sensible to do in my code Optimization: Refactor TrailSystem to use a single Points object with a BufferGeometry. Maintain an array of particle data (position, velocity, lifetime, color) and update it in update. Initialize with enough capacity (e.g., 100 particles), reusing slots for new particles. Update positions in a single Float32Array and set geometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true.
Impact: Reduces draw calls from hundreds to one per frame, boosting performance without losing the fire-like trail effect.
